# DNA Sequence Alignment

Course work from CS141

Practice of Dynamic programming

Identify region of similarity between two DNA sequences using

Output an alignment of 2 DNA sequences and a penalty score of the similarity between 2 sequences. Higher on the penalty score means worth on the similarity.

## Example: 
DNA sequece: \
`GTGCAATCGCTGGCGGCGTAG` \
`AGCATAATACCCCTATACTGT`

\
Result: \
`GTGC--AAT-CGCTGGCGGCG-TA--G-` \
`A-GCATAATAC-C---C--CTATACTGT`\
`Score: 9`
